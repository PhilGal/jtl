var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "jtl",
	Short: "Jtl is a command-line tool for posting worktime logs to a Jira server",
	Long: `These are common Jtl commands used in various situations:

  # log your work as you go to a local file (see: 'jtl help log'),
  # display summary report (see: 'jtl help report'),
  # finally, push all data from file to your company's remote server (see: 'jtl help push')
  
For better experience, it is recommended to add a valid configuration file $HOME/.jtl/config.yaml. Type 'jtl help push' for more details.

When you call any command, a programm is trying to locate a data file $HOME/data/<month-year>.csv Thus, each month you'll have a new data file.
There is, however, a possibility to force programm to use a particular data file with '--data' global option. If you use decide to use --data, use it with every command, because it is a runtime option.
Same goes for the config file with '--config' option.
